# ðŸ“‘ Deep Learning: Cultivar Recognition

This project focuses on classifying tomato cultivars from the dataset [Tomato Cultivars](https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/tomato-cultivars). The dataset contains around 700-800 images of size 160x160x3, categorized into 15 different tomato cultivars. The images are stored in Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5).

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Images in PNG format, labeled by file prefixes.
- **Tools and Libraries**:
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Machine Learning in Python
  - [Keras](https://keras.io/): Python Deep Learning Library
  - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): Open Source Machine Learning Framework
  - [Neural Structured Learning](https://github.com/tensorflow/neural-structured-learning): Library for adversarial learning

## Installation

First, ensure you have the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install neural_structured_learning
```

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

The data is downloaded from the provided URL and loaded using the HDF5 format. Images are resized and split into training, validation, and test sets. The dataset is then converted into PyTorch `Dataset` and `DataLoader` objects.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Scikit-Learn Algorithms

- **Random Forest Classifier**:
  - Trained and evaluated on the reshaped image data.
  - Performance metrics: accuracy, hamming loss.

### CNN-Based Models with Adversarial Regularization

- **Custom CNN**:
  - Built using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - Utilizes adversarial regularization for improved performance.

### TensorFlow Hub Models

- **MobileNetV2**:
  - Pretrained model used for feature extraction and fine-tuning.
- **InceptionV3**:
  - Another pre-trained model used for feature extraction and classification.

### TorchVision Models

- **VGG16**:
  - Pretrained VGG16 model modified for the task.
  - Fine-tuned and evaluated using PyTorch.

## Code Overview
